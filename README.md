# 🧠 Algorithms in C

A structured collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in pure C language**, made for learners, contributors, and developers who want to strengthen their DSA foundations through clear, readable, and working implementations.

## 📘 About

This repository is built to help learners understand the **core logic** behind algorithms without getting distracted by unnecessary abstraction or OOP concepts.  
It contains **clean, commented, and modular C programs** for different algorithmic problems and data structures.

The focus is on:
- Simplicity and clarity 🧩  
- Educational purpose 📚  
- Hands-on learning through code 💻  

All implementations:
- ✅ Written in **C99/C11 standard**
- ✅ **Self-contained** (no external libraries)
- ✅ Include **example runs**
- ✅ Have **time and space complexity** explained in comments
